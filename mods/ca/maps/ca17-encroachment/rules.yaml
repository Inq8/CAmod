		Briefing: You have impressed the Supervisor and have been deemed worthy of greater command responsibility. In the absence of reinforcements from the homeworld, we must now work towards securing territory around our central ichor repository.\n\nThe bulk of our fleet is engaged with human forces, providing us with an opportunity to launch a ground assault against two high priority targets.\n\nTwo cooperating human factions have been observed making use of powerful offensive assets, in the form of an orbital weapons platform and a machine capable of manipulating atmopsheric conditions to create localised storms.\n\nIf our central repository is discovered, they will no doubt attempt to use these weapons against it. They must be destroyed to remove this possibility.
