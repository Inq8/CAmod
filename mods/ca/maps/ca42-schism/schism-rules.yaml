	MissionData:
		Briefing: The Overlord sends his gratitude and is consolidating his forces for a new offensive.\n\nThe device that Kane has been using to deform Tiberium for his own nefarious ends has been located in a rebel stronghold. Its purification waves have been growing more powerful with each use, affecting a progressively larger area of the planet and resulting in countless Scrin joining the deceiver Kane. The rebels will soon be unstoppable.\n\nThe Overlord cannot risk bringing his armies too close to the device, but we have a plan. We have discovered that our Iron Curtain protects against the purification energy in a way that the Scrin shields do not. With this in mind, the Overlord will provide us with one of his few remaining Exterminator Tripods with which to assault rebel fortress. As long usages of the Iron Curtain are timed correctly, we believe it will allow the Exterminator to breach the rebel defenses, reach the device, and extract it using a Scrin wormhole.\n\nThis was the prize that Kane came to this world to claim, and we believe its power goes far beyond what we have seen.  Such power cannot be left in his hands. The Overlord must have the device so that its power can be used to restore order. Kane will surely have to draw a line in the sand here, or all of his efforts will be for naught, so expect heavy resistance.\n\nWe have assembled what forces we can, but our initial attemps to establish a base stalled due to constant attacks. There is no time for additional preparations. Launch the attack, escort the Exterminator to the device and secure it for the Overlord.
