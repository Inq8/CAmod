		Briefing: With our rivals defeated, we must now begin rebuilding our forces. Our production capacity was crippled by the Scrin so we must look elsewhere for equipment to meet our immediate needs.\n\nThe Chinese have long persisted in their selfish prioritization of their own economic interests, refusing to aid us militarily, however their quiet yet rapid military buildup has caught the eye of GDI who, under the guise of "safeguarding regional stability", have established a large military presence a short distance from the Chinese border.\n\nThis has predictably outraged the Chinese leadership, so we have made an arrangement with them in secret.\n\nYou must take a small force to a depot containing Chinese vehicles near the border. Take these vehicles across the border and destroy the nearest GDI outpost. We can then send in additional forces to establish our own base and eliminate the remaining GDI presence.\n\nThus, GDI will be removed without the Chinese having to involve themselves directly, and the Chinese will get a live test of their new weapons against a peer adversary. In return they have agreed to sell their weapons to us, which will allow us to return to full strength at a greatly accelerated rate.
