	MissionData:
		Briefing: With the gateway under our control, Kane has been prevented from returning to Earth, and our forces are now prepared to journey to the Scrin homeworld where we will assist the Overlord to defeat the rebels and eliminate Kane.\n\nA Nod base exists on the other side. Kane may attempt to make a stand there, but it is more likely he has fled into the shadows as he has done before. Regardless, our first task will be to establish a base of operations and secure the immediate vicinity. The nearby Nerve Center will need to be captured to ensure the gateway remains open.\n\nWe we will be venturing deep into rebel territory, so do not expect the Overlord to be able to assist you. Opening up a new front here should relieve some of the pressure his forces are experiencing elsewhere on the planet.\n\nWipe out any Nod or rebel forces you encounter. Show the Overlord what a powerful ally we can be.
