		Briefing: ———[    Chapter VI Introduction    ]———\n\nAs the Scrin mothership fell from the sky in flames, the cyborgs surrounding it revealed their true allegiance. The Scrin, stranded in both space and time, were manipulated into opening a gateway to their homeworld with Kane's army at the threshold. \n\nWhile his ultimate objective is unclear, GDI are unwilling to let him pursue it uncontested. The gateway has remained open, but is rapidly destabilizing and it appears likely that it will collapse soon. Time is running out for GDI to give chase.\n\n———[    Mission Briefing (GDI)   ]———\n\nOur forces are almost ready and our recon drones have confirmed that the atmosphere and climatic conditions on the other side of the gateway will support human life.\n\nClearly, this is uncharted territory. We must establish a foothold from which we can base our operations. We have detected minimal Scrin presence in the immediate vicinity of our destination, and no sign of Kane or his army.\n\nShortly after Kane departed we detected an energy surge emanating from the Scrin signal transmitter. We believe this was caused by the gateway's exit point being shifted. Kane clearly didn't want us following closely behind, but it does beg the question; why did he leave the door open at all?\n\nThe gateway has become too unstable for heavier equipment to make it through, but research into Scrin wormhole technology gathered since their arrival has provided us with some understanding of how the portals work.\n\nA gateway requires bi-directional flow of energy to be sustained. Our side is taken care of, but without a corresponding transmission from the other side the gateway will eventually lose cohesion.\n\nScrin Nerve Centers are capable of providing such an energy flow, so if we can locate and capture one close enough to the exit point, the gateway should be stabilized.\n\nYour first objective is to deploy sensor arrays in the area around the exit. We should then be able to detect a suitable Nerve Center to capture, allowing us to bring heavier forces and establish a base. Then the area must be cleared of any remaining hostile forces.
