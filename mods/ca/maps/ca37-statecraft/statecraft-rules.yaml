	MissionData:
		Briefing: Stalin is gone and the union is in disarray. A number of ambitious generals and high ranking officials are vying for power. We must act quickly to secure our position and restore order. Together we can bring the Soviet Empire back from the brink of total collapse.\n\nTake what few troops we can spare and establish a base, then beat the three most prominent factions into submission.\n\nThe factions are led by General Marinesko, General Krukov and Deputy Chairman Romanov, each of whom favor a particular combat doctrine. Use your best judgement to decide who to deal with first, and be careful not to tip the balance of power too quickly or they may all unite against you.
