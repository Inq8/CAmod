    • Primary anti-aircraft vehicles (IFV, BTR, Vulcan, Stealth Tank and Gun/Shard Walker) and static anti-aircraft defenses take 50% damage from aircraft.

    • When low power all production is reduced to half speed.

    • Units will only move to attack in Attack Anything stance.

    • Helipads/Airfields will repair landed aircraft if they are close to a Supply Depot.
