encyclopedia-tips-general-description = • Most infantry prone when they are fired upon, which makes them move more slowly but makes them take 50% less damage.

    • Primary anti-aircraft vehicles (IFV, BTR, Vulcan, Stealth Tank and Gun/Shard Walker) and static anti-aircraft defenses take 50% damage from aircraft.

    • Primary anti-aircraft units and aircraft with air-to-air capability will prioritize firing at aircraft when auto targeting or attack moving.

    • Most anti-air weapons will deal splash damage in a large radius. This is to increase the diminishing returns of massing aircraft.

    • When low power all production is reduced to half speed.

    • Units will only move to attack in Attack Anything stance.

    • Cloaked units can be detected by any adjacent infantry, as well as by scout units and certain other detectors.

    • Helipads/Airfields will repair landed aircraft if they are close to a Service Depot (or its equivalents).

    • Many units have abilities that can be used via the deploy key (F by default).

    • You can control the direction of most reinforcement/airstrike support powers by dragging the mouse.

    • The "Competitive" production type is designed to reduce the effectiveness of tier 1 spam. Each production structure has its own queue, but additional production structures of each type initially cost significantly more than the first, and the cost can then be reduced by building a Radar or Service Depot, and further reduced by building a Tech Center or Allied HQ.

    • Transports can be mass loaded using Alt-click. It will cause all selected units to fill the closest transports of the type that was clicked on.

    • Upgrades with an yellow-orange border are sidegrades, meaning they have negative as well as positive effects.

    • Upgrades with a "beaker" icon in the top right do not affect existing units, which either need to be upgraded via a Service Depot (or equivalent), or cannot be upgraded.

    • Mines and explosives attached to buildings (C4, TNT) can be disarmed by Engineers/Assimilators.

    • Bridges can be repaired by Engineers/Assimilators (they are not consumed in the process).

    • Structures that provide support powers, advanced defences, and the Radar Dome (or its equivalents) can be powered down using the power down key (X by default) or using the button in the top right.

    • Neutral structures can be captured by Engineers/Assumilators even after they have been destroyed.

    • Service Depot repairs are completely free. Vehicles can be sold while being repaired.

    • All production times are proportional to cost. The cost to time ratio is lower for Refineries, MCVs and higher for upgrades.
