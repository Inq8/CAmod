	MissionData:
		Briefing: Intelligence gathered from the Nod naval base has put us hot on Nod's trail. The transports we captured were waiting to board a disguised cargo vessel which has now also been captured. Based on its navigational logs we have used our satellites and located what appears to be a research facility hidden in a disused quarry in North Africa.\n\nNod submarines will make a large scale landing difficult, but if we can establish a base on the coast we'll be able to launch an offensive from there.\n\nWith GDI's assistance we have been able to augment our harvesters and refineries to harvest the Tiberium crystals that are becoming widespread. Nod also has a harvesting operation in the area. Gather what resources you can without alerting Nod to our presence, build up your forces, then capture their research facility.
