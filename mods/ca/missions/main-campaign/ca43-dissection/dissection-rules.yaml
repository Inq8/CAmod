		Briefing: Hope for peace with the Soviets is all but lost. The potential successors to Stalin that were somewhat open to diplomacy have been eliminated by their new premier Antoly Cherdenko, who — in his mad pursuit of more power — has done the unthinkable and aligned himself with the Scrin Overlord, apparently preventing the Overlord's defeat at the hands of rebel forces.\n\nWhile GDI, Nod and Scrin forces were busy fighting on the Scrin homeworld, the Soviets engaged in a massive rearmament program, and now with the Overlord's assistance they have begun open hostilities once again.\n\nOur relationship with GDI has soured. The official line is that they no longer trust us with matters of security and defense, largely due to the escape of Yuri and the Scrin Prodigy. This reeks of hypocrisy, and we suspect they are hiding something and are using this an excuse, however we cannot afford our alliance with them to disintegrate, so for now we are putting our suspicions aside.\n\nThere are also troubling reports of a new threat; a third Scrin faction that is waging war indiscriminately. It seems they have already established a gateway to Earth, but we are awaiting confirmation of this.\n\nOur resources are stretched to the limit as we contend with enemies on many fronts. Allied High Command is due to meet to discuss options and formulate a strategy moving forward, but a situation has been unfolding that requires our immediate attention.\n\nThe Soviets have pushed south through Greece, all the way to the Mediterranean coast. Their goal appears to be Turkey, which is the only realistic staging ground for any strike against their gateway to the Scrin homeworld.\n\nOur forces in Turkey are now completely cut off and are being encircled. We cannot let the Soviets establish a buffer zone which places their gateway out of reach, as this will allow the Overlord's forces to continue flooding in.\n\nOur positions either side of the Soviet salient are crumbling under Soviet rocket bombardment and need urgent reinforcement. Take control of what forces remain and push the Soviets back.\n\nWhile they are a minor Allied power, the Greeks have been developing some impressive new weaponry that should prove useful in this mission.
